## **PROJECTS**

### **PDF Summarization Tool** ([GitHub](#))
- A PDF Summarization Tool using Flask, which summarizes large documents into precise summaries and generates interactive flashcards and quizzes, utilizing NLP models like TextRank, LexRank, Luhn, LSA, T5, and BART to enhance user engagement and learning.

### **Automated People Detections and Device Control** ([GitHub](#))
- A real-time object detection system using YOLOv5 on NVIDIA Jetson Nano to automatically control a smart plug based on people presence, enhancing energy efficiency in smart environments. The system, integrated with a Flask server, streams video with live detection overlays, optimizing for GPU with CPU fallback.

### **Injury Severity Prediction in Traffic Accidents** ([GitHub](#))
- Created a Machine Learning model to predict injury severity in traffic accidents for Tempe City, enhancing road safety and emergency response strategies. Analyzed extensive datasets detailing vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian collisions, and employed RandomForestClassifier and GradientBoostingClassifier to derive critical insights for traffic safety improvements.

### **Uber Trip Data Analysis** ([GitHub](#))
- Analyzed 23 million Uber trip records for 2021 and 2022 using Apache Spark in Databricks, uncovering key urban travel patterns and financial metrics to enhance ride-sharing efficiency. Derived insights identified peak periods and high-demand locations, guiding actionable recommendations to improve ride-sharing services.
